There are many different locations to visit in the world. Civilised locations include small settlements and campsites, villages and towns. Here you can find other adventurers, merchants and people who might have a job for you.
<br><br>

Natural wild areas includes forests, caves and mountains. You might find treasure in these places but enemy creatures will surely find you. Ensure you are well stocked-up on items when exploring new locations, as danger is never too far away.
